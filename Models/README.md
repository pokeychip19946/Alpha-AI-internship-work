Step 1 -  Download models and extract them

Step 2 - download YOLO v5 from this repo, follow the readme(inside the YOLOv5s folder) and directly paste the model files into downloaded yolov5-master folder

QR Code detection is diffrent from other detection models so no need to put QR code into yolov5-master folder_

NOTE- In each model folder their is a detect.py file which is same for all the models(their is no difference so you can use any of the detect.py for each and every models) 
I kept detect.py file in each model zipped folder just for easy access nothing else :)
